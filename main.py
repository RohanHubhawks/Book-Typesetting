Excerpts from Dhruv&#39;s journal:
I can smell winter in the air
The petals of the rose
I gave you on the last day of July
Fall mercilessly
Remembering your foggy breath
Meandering its way to mine
Through the smoke between us
As we drifted through the city
Hand in hand
Gushing with the blowing August wind
You lit a cigarette
And I smoked with you
Under the warm glow
Of the slipping september sun
Bringing with it an everlasting October

I can smell winter in the air
As November creaks
And a chill runs down my spine
The rose petals shudder
And so do I

“At the end of the day, love never goes to waste. We’re put in this world only to love and
learn. Later in life, you’ll look back, and reminisce how you didn’t even realise that through
all this ache and confusion, you were simply getting closer to your destiny. ” Mrs. Malhotra
said to his son as he stumbled home drunk again, in the dead of the night. “I don’t know what
I am doing, Ma!” he slurred. A dishevelled, bearded face, damp with half-dried tears, resting
in his mother’s lap.

A whole goddamn year had passed, but the twenty-one-year-old Dhruv Malhotra continued to
walk deliriously into bars, filling the void she left in his heart with alcohol, cigarettes and the
company of strange women.

“Wow! That’s deep.” Anisha stood there, looking at him intently for a few minutes.
“Why so serious, Ms Sighania?” He said whimsically, to lighten the air.
“Just trying to process your depth, Mr. Malhotra.”
“It’s not that serious man.” He chuckled, “I mean, I am decent at math so maybe I can work
at a bank.” He chuckled. “ Buy and sell stocks. Work on deals. I don’t know.”
“You’re such a terrific musician. Why don’t you want to do something with your talent?”
“I don’t know. I guess I don’t want to play for the world. I want to keep this only for myself.”
She took a moment to absorb his ideas and then suddenly stood up. “Can we smoke?”

****

After that day, they began to hang out often. Anisha became a regular visitor at the Malhotra
house in Sainik Farms. They would talk for hours, listen to new records, order in food and
watch movies. One evening when Anisha was unusually quiet, they went up to the terrace
and sat there on the uneven concrete floor watching the sun setting behind the horizon,
staining the sky blood red.
&quot;I was sixteen when my dad died.&quot; She stared into nothingness as she spoke, and it seemed as
though words came out of her mouth without her consent. The shadow of her hair falling on
her bony face danced on her cheek as slight darkness began to set in.
Dhruv was surprised at her sudden confession. She never told him much about her family and
was unusually reserved when it came to her parents. But that day, she looked
uncharacteristically sad as she continued talking.
&quot;It was cancer.”

Excerpts from Dhruv&#39;s journal:
I can smell winter in the air
The petals of the rose
I gave you on the last day of July
Fall mercilessly
Remembering your foggy breath
Meandering its way to mine
Through the smoke between us
As we drifted through the city
Hand in hand
Gushing with the blowing August wind
You lit a cigarette
And I smoked with you
Under the warm glow
Of the slipping september sun
Bringing with it an everlasting October

I can smell winter in the air
As November creaks
And a chill runs down my spine
The rose petals shudder
And so do I

- (Seasons &amp; Significance), Dhruv

“At the end of the day, love never goes to waste. We’re put in this world only to love and
learn. Later in life, you’ll look back, and reminisce how you didn’t even realise that through
all this ache and confusion, you were simply getting closer to your destiny. ” Mrs. Malhotra
said to his son as he stumbled home drunk again, in the dead of the night. “I don’t know what
I am doing, Ma!” he slurred. A dishevelled, bearded face, damp with half-dried tears, resting
in his mother’s lap.

A whole goddamn year had passed, but the twenty-one-year-old Dhruv Malhotra continued to
walk deliriously into bars, filling the void she left in his heart with alcohol, cigarettes and the
company of strange women.

“Wow! That’s deep.” Anisha stood there, looking at him intently for a few minutes.
“Why so serious, Ms Sighania?” He said whimsically, to lighten the air.
“Just trying to process your depth, Mr. Malhotra.”
“It’s not that serious man.” He chuckled, “I mean, I am decent at math so maybe I can work
at a bank.” He chuckled. “ Buy and sell stocks. Work on deals. I don’t know.”
“You’re such a terrific musician. Why don’t you want to do something with your talent?”
“I don’t know. I guess I don’t want to play for the world. I want to keep this only for myself.”
She took a moment to absorb his ideas and then suddenly stood up. “Can we smoke?”

****

After that day, they began to hang out often. Anisha became a regular visitor at the Malhotra
house in Sainik Farms. They would talk for hours, listen to new records, order in food and
watch movies. One evening when Anisha was unusually quiet, they went up to the terrace
and sat there on the uneven concrete floor watching the sun setting behind the horizon,
staining the sky blood red.
&quot;I was sixteen when my dad died.&quot; She stared into nothingness as she spoke, and it seemed as
though words came out of her mouth without her consent. The shadow of her hair falling on
her bony face danced on her cheek as slight darkness began to set in.
Dhruv was surprised at her sudden confession. She never told him much about her family and
was unusually reserved when it came to her parents. But that day, she looked
uncharacteristically sad as she continued talking.
&quot;It was cancer.”
